Workshop Introduction to Machine Learning using Swimming Examples 

## 1. Using Google Sheets to open and process data:

1. Download file to read
2. Open and copy the google sheet to you own drive

[![Open Google Sheets](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Sheets-34A853?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-sheets&logoColor=white)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yIz6kJ5t19BigsNlHxu8BjBJWgoee4vm-rpZInNG0gE/edit?usp=sharing])
*Sw01_ExcelProcessing.ipynb*

3. Upload the data
4. Replace all . by , 
5. Plot "Roll" axis over "Time"
6. Calculate features from all signal sources.

## 2. Using Google Collaboratory to open and process data:

1. Open and copy the notebook to your own drive

*Sw01_ColabProcessing.ipynb*

2. Clone this repository
3. Read the data
4. Plot "Roll" axis over "Time"
5. Calculate features from all signal sources.

## 3. Classification of Swimming Styles using Machine Learning:

1. Open and copy the notebook to your own drive

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I1_dQ8sF3dFk3nE05YFVgCND_q-7l04u?usp=sharing)
*Sw02_ColabClassification.ipynb*

2. Clone this repository
3. Read the features and the labels
4. Import model and train
5. Test model and plot the results
